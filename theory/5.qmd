## Lesson Overview

In the last lesson, we focused on the simple linear regression model. Now, we will expand the number of explanatory variables to get the multiple linear regression model, and we will discuss how our OLS estimation process changes as a result.

This lesson covers the following topics:

-   Omitted variable bias as a motivation for the need for multiple linear regression.
-   The estimation process of the OLS estimator for Multiple Linear Regression.
-   What it means to control for a variable (using the regression anatomy theory).
-   How we can use the regression anatomy theory to create an analogous estimate for OLS.

# 1.5.1: Motivation: Omitted Variable Bias

In the [last lesson](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/4.html), we covered the simple linear regression model. However, there is a major issue with the simple linear regression model: omitted variable bias.

Consider two regressions. The first regression, the "short" regression, is a simple linear regression, like the one we covered in the [last lesson](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/4.html). The second regression, the "long" regression, contains an extra variable $z$ that is omitted from the first regression:

$$
\begin{split}y_i & = \beta_0^S + \beta_1^Sx_i + u_i^S \quad \text{short} \\y_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \beta_2z_i + u_i \quad \text{long}\end{split}
$$

-   Note: the $S$ in $\beta_0^S$ is a subscript representing short. It is not an exponent.

Now consider an auxiliary regression, where the omitted variable $z$ is the outcome variable, and $x$ is the explanatory variable:

$$
z_i = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_i + v_i
$$

-   where $\delta_0, \delta_1$ are coefficients and $v_i$ is the error term

<br />

Now we have $z$ in terms of $x$, let us plug $z$ into our long regression to "recreate" the short regression:

$$
\begin{split}y_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \beta_2z_i + u_i \\y_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2(\delta_0 + \delta_1x_i + v_i) + u_i \\y_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 \delta_0 + \beta_2 \delta_1 x_i + \beta_2v_i + u_i \\y_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_2 \delta_0 + (\beta_1 + \beta_2 \delta_1)x_i + \beta_2v_i + u_i\end{split}
$$

We have "recreated" the short regression with one variable $x$. Let us see our recreation next to the original short regression:

$$
\begin{split}
y_i & = \beta_0^S + \beta_1^Sx_i + u_i^S \\
y_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_2 \delta_0 + (\beta_1 + \beta_2 \delta_1)x_i + \beta_2v_i + u_i
\end{split}
$$

-   The short regression coefficient $\beta_0^S$ is analogous to the $\beta_0 + \beta_2 \delta_0$ in the recreation (both are the intercepts)
-   The short regression coefficient $\beta_1^S x_i$ is analogous to the $(\beta_1 + \beta_2 \delta_1)x_i$ in the recreation (both are the slope and variable of interest)
-   The short regression $u_i^S$ is analogous to the $\beta_2 v_i + u_i$ in the recreation (both are the error terms).

Since the short regression $\beta_1^S x_i$ is analogous to the $(\beta_1 + \beta_2 \delta_1)x_i$ in the recreation, that means coefficient $\beta_1^S = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \delta_1$.

<br />

Thus, the difference between the short regression (simple linear regression) coefficient $\beta_1^S$, and the original long regression coefficient $\beta_1$, is $\beta_2 \delta_1$.

-   If $\beta_2 = 0$ (meaning no relationship between omitted $x$ and $y$), or $\delta_1 = 0$ (meaning no relationship between omitted $x$ and $x$), then difference $\beta_2 \delta_1 = 0$, thus there is no difference.
-   But if either of those facts are not true, then $\beta_2 \delta_1 ≠ 0$, and omitted variable bias is non-zero.

More intuitively, if the omitted variable $z$ is both correlated with $x$ and $y$, then the two coefficients are different by $\beta_2 \delta_1$.

-   Any variable $z$ correlated both with $x$ and $y$ is called a **confounding variable**.
-   This $\beta_2 \delta_1$ amount is called the **omitted variable bias**.

<br />

What are the implications of non-zero omitted variable bias?

-   We can see, that when we add a extra variable $z$, our estimate for parameter $\beta_1$ changes by $\beta_2 \delta_1$.
-   What that means is that [our original short simple linear regression is incorrectly estimating the parameter $\beta_1$ by $\beta_2 \delta_1$.]{.underline}

Thus, [to prevent the incorrect estimation of the simple linear regression model, we must add confounding variables $z$ to our regression]{.underline}.

This is where multiple linear regression comes in:

-   Multiple linear regression will allow us to add additional variables to our regressions.
-   By adding additional variables, we will be able to "control" for the effect of these confounding variables, and more accurately estimate the relationship between $x$ and $y$. We will discuss this idea of "controlling" in [1.5.5](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/5.html#regression-anatomy-and-controlling-for-confounders).

# 1.5.2: The Multiple Linear Regression Model

Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression, that can help us deal with confounding variables.

-   Multiple linear regression allows us to "control for the effect" of confounders. We will discuss this idea of "controlling" in [1.5.5](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/5.html#regression-anatomy-and-controlling-for-confounders).

The **response variable** (outcome variable) is notated $y$, just like in single linear regression.

The **explanatory variable**s are $x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$. We sometimes also denote all explanatory variables as the vector $\overrightarrow{x}$.

-   $k$ represents the total number of explanatory variables.
-   Note: if you see the notation $x_j$, that means any explanatory variable $x_1, \dots , x_k$. The variable $x_j$ represents any individual coefficient (for generalisation purposes).

<br />

The multiple linear regression takes the following form:

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Multiple Linear Regression Model

Take a set of observed data with $n$ number of pairs of $(\overrightarrow{x}_i, y_i)$ observations. The linear model takes the following form:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \dots + \beta_k x_{ki} + u_i
$$

-   Where the coefficients (that need to be estimated) are vector$\overrightarrow{\beta} = \beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_k$. That means we have $k$ number of variables and $k+1$ number of coefficients (with the one not attached to a variable being the intercept).
-   Where $u_i$ is the error term function - that determines the error for each unit $i$. Error $u_i$ has a variance of $\sigma^2$, and expectation $E(u_i) = 0$.
:::

<br />

Same as in Simple Linear Regression, once we have estimated $\overrightarrow\beta$, we will have a best-fit **plane**, also called a fitted-values model (see [1.4.2](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/4.html#fitted-values-and-best-fit-lines)). The fitted values model takes the form:

$$
\hat y_i = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 x_{1i} + \dots + \hat\beta_k x_{ki}
$$

-   Where $\hat y$ are the predicted values of $y$ based on our best-fit plane.
-   Where $\hat\beta_0, \dots, \hat\beta_k$ are our estimates for coefficients $\beta_0, \dots, \beta_k$.
-   Just like in simple linear regression, the error term $u_i$ dispersal because $E(u_i) = 0$.

Note how I have been saying best-fit **plane**, not best-fit line. This is because with multiple explanatory variables, we are now no longer in a 2-dimensional space, but a $k$-dimensional space (based on the number of variables).

-   Essentially, each variable has its own axis/dimension.
-   Mathematically, we are now in a $\mathbb{R}^k$ space.

Thus, our best-fit line now is a best-fit plane. For example, take this model with 2 explanatory variables $x_1$ (years of education), $x_2$ (seniority), and $y$ (income):

![](images/clipboard-365376575.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Any point on this plane is a part of our best-fit plane.

# 1.5.3: Multiple Linear Regression with Linear Algebra

::: callout-warning
This section contains Linear Algebra. It is not essential that you understand this section, however, it can be helpful to develop intuition.
:::

In the previous section, we introduced the multiple linear regression model as the following:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \dots + \beta_k x_{ki} + u_i
$$

However, it can be very useful to also see the multiple linear regression model in terms of linear algebra (vectors and matrices).

-   The main reason for this is because this will make the estimation process far easier.

<br />

The $i$'th observation can be re-written in vector form as following:

$$
y_i = x_i'\beta + u_i, \text{ where }\beta = \begin{bmatrix}\beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \\ \vdots \\ \beta_k\end{bmatrix} \text{ and }x_i = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\x_{1i} \\\vdots \\x_{ki}\end{bmatrix}
$$

-   The $x_i'$ in the equation is the transpose of $x_i$, to make matrix multiplication possible.
-   The first element of the $x_i$ matrix is 1, since $1 \times \beta_0$ gives us the first parameter (intercept) in the linear model.
-   Thus, when multiplying out, we get the same equation as the original multiple linear regression.

<br />

Note how we have the subscript $i$ representing each individual observation. With a vector, we can expand out these subscripts.

-   For example, instead of $y_i$, we could have a vector with $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n$ (assuming we have $n$ observations).
-   Same for $x'_i$, which can be expanded into a vector of $x_1', x_2', \dots x_n'$, and for the error term $u_i$, which can be expanded into a vector of $u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n$.

Using this logic, we can obtain the following, with the $x_i'$ and $\beta$ being vectors within a vector:

$$
\begin{split}
\begin{pmatrix}y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n\end{pmatrix} & = \begin{pmatrix}x_1'\beta + u_1 \\ x_2'\beta + u_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n'\beta + u_n\end{pmatrix} \\
& \\
\begin{pmatrix}y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n\end{pmatrix}& = \begin{pmatrix}x_1'\beta \\ x_2'\beta \\ \vdots \\ x_n'\beta\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n\end{pmatrix}
\end{split}
$$

Since $\beta$ vector appears as a common factor for all observations $i=1,...,n$, we can factor it out and have an equation:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}x_1' \\ x_2' \\ \vdots \\ x_n'\end{pmatrix} \space \beta + \begin{pmatrix}u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n\end{pmatrix}
$$

<br />

We can expand the $x_1',...,x_n'$ vector into a matrix. Remember that each $x_1',...,x_n'$ is already a vector of different explanatory variables. So, we get the following result:

$$
y = X \beta + u, \text{ where } X = \begin{bmatrix}1 & x_{21} & \dots & x_{k1} \\1 & x_{22} & \dots & x_{k2} \\\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\1 & x_{2n} & \dots & x_{kn}\end{bmatrix}
$$

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Multiple Linear Regression with Linear Algebra

The multiple linear regression can be expressed in linear algebra as:

$$
y = X \beta + u
$$

Where vector $y$ is equal to:

$$
y = \begin{pmatrix}y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n\end{pmatrix} 
$$

Where matrix $X$ is equal to:

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}1 & x_{21} & \dots & x_{k1} \\1 & x_{22} & \dots & x_{k2} \\\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\1 & x_{2n} & \dots & x_{kn}\end{bmatrix}
$$

-   Where the notation for elements of $X$ is $x_{ki}$, with $i$ being the unit of observation $i = 1, \dots n$, and $k$ being the explanatory variables index.
-   The first column of $X$ is a vector of 1, which exists because these 1's are multiplied with $\beta_0$ in our model (see below).

Where vector $\beta$ is equal to:

$$
\beta = \begin{pmatrix}\beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \\ \vdots \\ \beta_k\end{pmatrix}
$$
:::

The point of expressing the model in linear algebra is that it makes the estimation process far easier, as we will see in the next section.

# 1.5.4: Mathematics of the Ordinary Least Squares Estimator

::: callout-warning
This section contains Linear Algebra. It is not essential that you understand this section, however, it can be helpful to develop intuition.
:::

As we remember from [1.4.4](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/4.html#mathematics-of-the-ordinary-least-squares-estimator), the goal of Ordinary Least Squares Estimation is to minimise the sum of squared errors. The sum of squared errors in multiple regression is:

$$
\begin{split}
SSE & = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat y_i)^2\\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1x_{1i} -  \hat{\beta}_2x_{2i} -  ... - \hat\beta_kx_{ki})^2
\end{split}
$$

Similar to our simple linear regression (but with additional variables), our minimisation condition is:

$$
\begin{split}
(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2, ...) & = \min\limits_{(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2, ...)} (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1x_{1i} -  \hat{\beta}_2x_{2i} ...)^2 \\
& = \min\limits_{(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2, ...)} S(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2, ...)
\end{split}
$$

<br />

Taking the partial derivatives of each parameter like in simple linear regression (see [1.4.4](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/4.html#mathematics-of-the-ordinary-least-squares-estimator)), we get first order conditions:

$$
\begin{split}& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1x_{1i} -  \hat{\beta}_2x_{2i}...) = 0 \\& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_{1i}(y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1x_{1i} -  \hat{\beta}_2x_{2i}...) = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_{2i} (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1x_{1i} -  \hat{\beta}_2x_{2i}...) = 0
\end{split}
$$

-   and so on for $x_{3i}, ..., x_{ki}$.

This system of equations includes $k+1$ variables and $k+1$ equations, which is way too difficult to solve.

<br />

Instead, we can use linear algebra. Let us define our estimation vector $\hat{\beta}$ as the value of $\hat\beta$ that minimises the sum of squared errors:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \min\limits_{b} (y - Xb)' (y - Xb) = \min\limits_b S(b)
$$

-   $(y - Xb)$ is our error, since $\hat y = Xb$,

We can expand $S(b)$ as follows:

$$
\begin{split}
S(b) & = y'y - b'X'y - y'Xb + b'X'Xb \\ 
& = y'y - 2b'X'y + b'X'Xb
\end{split}
$$

Taking the partial derivative in respect to $b$:

$$
\frac{\partial S(b)}{\partial b} = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial S(b)}{\partial b_1} \\\vdots \\\frac{\partial S(b)}{\partial b_k}\end{pmatrix}
$$

Differentiating with the vector $b$ yields:

$$
\frac{\partial S(b)}{\partial b} = -2X'y + 2X'Xb
$$

Evaluted at $\hat{\beta}$, the derivatives should equal zero (since first order condition of finding minimums):

$$
\frac{\partial S(b)}{\partial b} \biggr|_{\hat{\beta}} = -2X'y + 2X'X \hat{\beta} = 0
$$

When assuming $X'X$ is invertable, we can isolate $\hat{\beta}$ to find the solution to OLS:

$$
\begin{split}
-2X'y + 2X'X \hat{\beta} & = 0 \\
2X'X\hat\beta & = 2X'y \\
\hat\beta & = (2X'X)^{-1} 2 X'y \\
\hat\beta & = (X'X)^{-1}X'y
\end{split}
$$

::: callout-tip
## Definition: OLS Estimate of $\hat\beta$

The Ordinary Least Squares Estimate of vector $\hat\beta$ for multiple linear regression is:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y
$$
:::

Once we have estimates of $\hat{\beta}$, we can plug them into our linear model to obtain fitted values:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{y} & = X\hat{\beta} \\
& = X(X'X)^{-1} X'y
\end{split}
$$

Note: in [lesson 1.6](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/6.html), we will discuss if the OLS estimator is a good estimator or not. For now, we just care about the mechanics of the estimator.

# 1.5.5: Regression Anatomy and Controlling for Confounders

We talked about how multiple linear regression allows us to control for confounders. But what does that mean? How does it affect our interpretations of coefficients?

The **Regression Anatomy** Theory, also called the **Frisch–Waugh–Lovell (FWL)** theorem, illustrates this concept. Take our standard multiple linear regression:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \beta_k x_{ki} + u_i
$$

<br />

Let us say we are interested in $x_1$ (this can be generalised to any explanatory variable $x_j$). Let us make $x_1$ the outcome variable of a regression with explanatory variables $x_2, ..., x_k$:

$$
x_{1i} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 x_{2i} + ... + \gamma_{k-1}x_{ki} + \widetilde{r_{1i}}
$$

-   Where $\gamma_0, ..., \gamma_{k-1}$ are coefficients.
-   Where $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$ is the error term.

The error term is $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$, which represents the part of $x_{1i}$ that are uncorrelated to $x_2, ..., x_k$.

-   In other words, $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$ is the part of $x_1$ that cannot be explained by any other explanatory variable $x_2, ..., x_k$. (uncorrelated with them)

<br />

Now, take the regression of with outcome variable $y$, with all explanatory variables [except]{.underline} $x_1$:

$$
y_i = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_{2i} + ... + \delta_{k-1} x_{ki} + \widetilde{y_i}
$$

-   Where $\delta_0, ..., \delta_{k-1}$ are coefficients.
-   Where $\widetilde {y_i}$ is the error term.

The error term is $\widetilde{y_i}$, which is the part of $y_i$ that cannot be explained by $x_2, ..., x_k$ (uncorrelated with them).

<br />

Since $\widetilde{y_i}$ is not explained by $x_2, ..., x_k$, variable $x_1$ must be the one explaining $\widetilde{y_i}$.

-   But, it is not the whole of $x_1$ explaining $\tilde{y_i}$.
-   This is since $x_1$ may also correlated with $x_2, ..., x_k$, and the correlated parts of $x_1$ with $x_2, ..., x_k$ are already picked up in the regression by the coefficients of $x_2, ..., x_k$.

Thus, $\widetilde{y_i}$ must be explained by the part of $x_1$ that is uncorrelated and not explained by $x_2, ..., x_k$, which we derived earlier as $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$.

<br />

Thus, we can create another regression with explanatory variable $\widetilde{x_{1i}}$ and outcome variable $\widetilde{y_i}$.

$$
\widetilde{y_i} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}} + u_i
$$

We can plug $\widetilde{y_i}$ back into our regression of $y_i$ with explanatory variables $x_2 ..., x_k$, and re-arrange:

$$
\begin{split}
y_i & = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_{2i} + ... + \delta_{k-1} x_{ki} + \widetilde{y_i} \\
y_i & = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_{2i} + ... + \delta_{k-1} x_{ki} + \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}} + u_i \\
y_i  & = (\delta_0 + \alpha_0) + \alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}} + \delta_1x_{2i} + ... + \delta_{k-1} x_{ki} + u_i 
\end{split}
$$

As we can see, this new regression mirrors the original standard multiple linear regression:

$$
\begin{split}
y_i  & = (\delta_0 + \alpha_0) + \alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}} + \delta_1x_{2i} + ... + \delta_{k-1} x_{ki} + u_i \\
y_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \dots + \beta_k x_{ki} + u_i
\end{split}
$$

-   The $\beta_0$ in the original is analogous to the $(\delta_0 + \alpha 0)$.
-   The $\beta_1 x_{1i}$ in the original is analogous to $\alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}}$.
-   The $\beta_2 x_{2i} + \dots + \beta_k x_{ki}$ is analogous to $\delta_1 x_{2i} + ... + \delta_{k-1} x_{ki}$.
-   The $u_i$ is in both regressions.

<br />

Importantly we know the $\beta_1 x_{1i}$ in the original is analogous to $\alpha_1 \widetilde{r_{1i}}$. Thus, [the estimate of $\alpha_1$ will be the same as $\beta_1$ in the original regression]{.underline}.

-   The coefficient $\alpha_1$ (which is equal to $\beta_1$) explains the expected change in $y$, given an increase in the part of $x_1$ uncorrelated with $x_2, ..., x_k$.
-   So essentially, [we have **partialed out** the effect of the other explanatory variables, and only focus on the effect on $y$ of the uncorrelated part of $x_1$ (which is $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$)]{.underline}

Or in other words, OLS in multiple linear regression estimates the effect of $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$ on $y$.

-   We can apply this to any explanatory variable $x_1, \dots, x_k$. The uncorrelated parts of any explanatory variable $x_j$ are labelled $\widetilde{r_{ji}}$.

<br />

Using all this info, we can interpret the meaning of any coefficient $\hat\beta_j$ on the relationship between $x_j$ and $y$:

::: callout-tip
## Interpretation of Coefficients in OLS

The interpretation of $\hat\beta_j$ coefficient, multiplied to variable $x_j$ is:

-   When $x_j$ increases by one unit, there is an expected $\hat\beta_j$ unit change in $y$, holding all other explanatory variables constant.

The interpretation of intercept $\hat\beta_0$ is still the same: it is the expected value of $y$ when all explanatory variables equal 0.
:::

We can also standardise our interpretations as shown in [1.4.5](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/4.html#interpretation-and-standardisation).

# 1.5.6: Regression Anatomy Formula for OLS Estimation

In the last section, we discussed the idea of regression anatomy, and how including confounding variables changes the estimates.

-   That instead of finding the effect of $x_j$ entirely on $y$, we partial out the effect of other explanatory variables, and only find the effect of the uncorrelated part of $x_j$ (labelled $\widetilde {r_{ji}}$) on $y$.

We have already discussed the mathematical solution of OLS in relation to linear algebra (see [1.6.4](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/6.html#mathematics-of-the-ordinary-least-squares-estimator)). However, we can also express the estimation solution of $\hat\beta_j$ in relation to the regression anatomy formula.

## Useful Properties of Summation

Before we start, here are a few key properties of summation

**Property 1:**

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) = 0
$$

-   This is because we can expand the left to $\sum x_i - \sum \bar x$.
-   Then, we know $\sum x_i = \sum \bar x$ (by the formula for mean), so $\sum x_i - \sum \bar x = 0$.

**Property 2:**

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \bar{y}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y}) 
$$

-   This is because on the right side can expand to $\sum [x_i(y_i - \bar y) - \bar x (y_i - \bar y)]$.
-   Then, split into $\sum x_i (y_i - \bar y) - \bar x \sum (y_i - \bar y)$.
-   We know that by property 1 (which applies to any variable), $\sum (y_i - \bar y) = 0$. Thus, the right side disappears, and we are left with $\sum x_i (y_i - \bar y)$.

**Property 3:**

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i(x_i - \bar{x}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

Let us start off with the OLS estimator for simple linear regression, which calculates the $\hat\beta_1$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ (which we derived in [1.4.4](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/4.html#mathematics-of-the-ordinary-least-squares-estimator)):

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

Let us look at the numerator. Let us expand the numerator:

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n [(x_i - \bar x)y_i - (x_i - \bar x) \bar y] \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x) \bar y \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \bar y\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x) \\
\end{split}
$$

We know that $\sum (x_i - \bar x) = 0$ from the above properties. Thus, we can further simplify to:

$$
\begin{split}
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \bar y\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x) \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \bar y(0) \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i
\end{split}
$$

Thus, putting the numerator back in, we now we have the equation:

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

<br />

We know that in multiple linear regression, $\hat\beta_j$ is not the full relationship between $x_j$ and $y$. Instead, it is the relationship of the part of $x_j$ that is uncorrelated with all other explanatory variables, and $y$.

-   So in other words, it is the relationship of $\widetilde{r_{ji}}$ on $y$.

::: callout-note
## Reminder: Regression Anatomy

Remember, in the last section, we defined $\widetilde{r_{ji}}$ as the error term in a regression of $x_j$ on all other explanatory variables:

$$
x_{ji} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 x_{1i} + ... + \gamma_{k-1}x_{ki} + \widetilde{r_{ji}}
$$

Thus, $\widetilde{r_{ji}}$ is the part of $x_j$ uncorrelated with any other explanatory variable.
:::

So, since multiple linear regression is the relationship of $\widetilde{r_{ji}}$ on $y$, instead of $x$ on $y$, let us replace the $x$'s in our formula with $\widetilde{r_{ji}}$:

$$
\hat{\beta}_j = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (\widetilde{r_{ji}} - E(\widetilde{r_{ji}}))y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n(\widetilde{r_{ji}} - E(\widetilde{r_{ji}}))^2}
$$

We can actually simplify this more with a property of regression - remember, that the error term of a regression $u$, should be such that $E(u)=0$.

We know that $\widetilde{r_{ji}}$ is also the error term of a regression, so, $E(\widetilde{r_{ji}}) = 0$ as well. Plugging that into our equation, we can get the regression anatomy formula for OLS.

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{\beta}_j & = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (\widetilde{r_{ji}} - E(\widetilde{r_{ji}}))y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n(\widetilde{r_{ji}} - E(\widetilde{r_{ji}}))^2} \\
\\
& = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (\widetilde{r_{ji}} - 0)y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n(\widetilde{r_{ji}} - 0)^2} \\
\\
& = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{ji}} \ y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde {r_{ji}}^2}
\end{split}
$$

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Regression Anatomy Formula

The OLS estimate of coefficient $\beta_j$ can be written in terms of regression anatomy as follows:

$$
\hat{\beta}_j = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{ji}} \ y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde {r_{ji}}^2}
$$

Note: in [lesson 1.6](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/6.html), we will discuss if the OLS estimator is a good estimator or not. For now, we just care about the mechanics of the estimator.

# 1.5.7: R-Squared and Goodness of Fit

In [1.4.6](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/4.html#r-squared-and-goodness-of-fit), we discussed R-squared as a measure of the goodness of fit of a model.

In multiple linear regression, R-squared is the exact same.

::: callout-tip
## Definition: R-Squared

The R-squared metric is a metric describing how good of a fit our model is.

R-Squared is the proportion of variation in $y$, explained by our model with all our explanatory variables.

Mathematically:

$$
R^2 = \frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}
$$

Where:

$$
\begin{split}
& SST = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar y)^2 \\
& SSE = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (\hat y_i - \bar y )^2 \\
& SSR = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (\hat u_i^2)
\end{split}
$$
:::

<br />

There is an additional property with $R^2$ in multiple linear regression: [$R^2$ never falls when another explanatory is added to the regression.]{.underline}

-   So essentially, any explanatory variable added to the regression will always boost R-squared.

This shows the downside of R-squared as a metric - if we just include random variables, by chance, these variables will explain the variation in $y$.

-   Thus, focusing on R-squared can result in models with silly or nonsensical explanatory variables.

We will discuss the importance of careful model selection in the later parts of the course, when we move to more applied statistics for social science purposes.

# Implementation in R

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
dta <- readRDS('data/data1.rds')
```

## Regression Estimation

To estimate a regression, we can use the *feols()* function from the package *fixest*, or we can use the base-R function *lm()*.

-   The syntax is the same for both (at least for now).
-   The *feols()* function does have a few advantages for techniques that will be discussed later, especially when it comes to causal inference and econometrics.

For the *feols()* function, we will need the *fixest* package. Make sure to install it if you have not previously (google how to install R-packages if needed).

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(fixest)
```

<br />

**Syntax:**

For the *feols()* function, the syntax is as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model <- feols(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = mydata)
summary(model)
```

-   Replace *model* with any name you want to store your regression model in.
-   Replace *y* with your outcome variable name, and *x1, x2, x3* with your explanatory variable name.
-   You can add more explanatory variables by adding + signs and *x4 + x5 ...* and so on. You can also remove explanatory variables down to only 1.
-   Replace *mydata* with the name of your dataframe.

The *lm()* function has the exact same syntax for simple linear regression, except that we replace *feols()* with *lm()*:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = mydata)
summary(model)
```

<br />

**Example:**

Let us run a regression with outcome variable *immatt* (attitude towards immigrants), explanatory variables *age* and *educ* (years of education), from the dataframe called *dta*:

```{r, message = FALSE}
my_model <- feols(immatt ~ age + educ, data = dta)
summary(my_model)
```

We can see in the estimate column, we get our intercept estimate $\hat\beta_0$, and our explanatory variables coefficient estimates $\hat\beta_1$ and $\hat\beta_2$.

The result is similar with *lm()*:

```{r, message = FALSE}
my_model <- lm(immatt ~ age + educ, data = dta)
summary(my_model)
```

<br />
