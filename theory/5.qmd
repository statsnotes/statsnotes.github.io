# 1.5.1: Algebraic Properties of OLS

Once we have our OLS estimates $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ (explained in [section 4.4](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/4.html#mathematics-of-the-ordinary-least-squares-estimator)), we can obtain both our fitted values, and the OLS residuals $\hat u_i$:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat u_i & = y_i - \hat y_i \\
& = y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i
\end{split}
$$

Important note, the residual $\hat u_i$ is different from the error $u_i$:

$$
\begin{split}
& u_i = y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i \\
& \hat u_i = y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i
\end{split}
$$

The figure below shows what a residual for a point looks like: the distance between the best fit line.

![](images/clipboard-3479749458.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

<br />

Recall that the OLS estimates $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ are chosen to satisfy the following first order conditions (see [section 4.4](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/4.html#mathematics-of-the-ordinary-least-squares-estimator)):

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0
\end{split}
$$

We can plug in $\hat u_i = y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i$ into the two conditions above to get:

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i \hat u_i = 0
\end{split}
$$

<br />

### Property 1: Sum of Residuals is 0

OLS residuals always add up to zero, since:

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i = 0
$$

-   This property ensures that the average value of $y_i$ in our data is the same as the average value of our predictions $\hat y_i$.

<br />

### Property 2: No Covariance Between Regressor and Residual.

Using the first order conditions of OLS, and the defintion of $\hat u_i$ from above, we know the following to be true:

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i = 0
$$

Which also means that $\bar{\hat u_i} = 0$ (since an average is just the sum divided by the number of observations, and the sum is equal to 0).

We also know that:

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i \hat u_i = 0
$$

Now, recall the formula for covariance discussed in [section 3.4](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/3.html#quantifying-relationships-with-covariance):

$$
Cov(x,y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n [(x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)] \\
$$

Thus, the covariance between $x$ and $\hat u$ is (by expanding, then recalling the properties discussed above):

$$
\begin{split}
cov(x, \hat u) & = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n [(x_i - \bar x)(\hat u_i - \bar{\hat u})] \\
& = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i \hat u_i - x_i \bar{\hat u} - \bar x \hat u_i + \bar x \bar {\hat u}) \\
& = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^nx_i \hat u_i - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i\bar{\hat u} - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \bar x \hat u_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\bar x \bar{\hat u} \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^nx_i \hat u_i - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i\bar{\hat u} - \bar x\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\bar x \bar{\hat u} \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{n}(0 -0-\bar x(0) + 0) \\
& = 0
\end{split}
$$

Thus, the covariance (and thus correlation) between $x$ and $\hat u$ must be zero.

<br />

### Property 3: Regression Line Passes Through Means

Remember our solution for $\hat\beta_0$ in OLS was $\hat\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$. Rearranging this equation, we get:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat\beta_0  & = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} \\
\hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 \bar x & = \bar y \\
\bar y & = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 \bar x
\end{split}
$$

Thus, the OLS estimated best-fit line always passes though point $(\bar x, \bar y)$ (the means of our data).

# 1.5.2: Unbiasedness of OLS Under the Gauss-Markov Theorem

An unbiased estimator, if we recall from [section 2.8](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2.html#properties-of-estimators), means that over many different estimates, the expected value of all the estimates is the true parameter value: $E(\hat{\theta}_n) = \theta$.

Unbiasedness is desirable property of causal estimators. Is OLS Unbiased? The Gauss-Markov Theorem proves that OLS is unbiased when 4 conditions are met.

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Gauss-Markov Theorem

The Gauss-Markov Theorem states that under 4 conditions, the OLS estimator is an unbiased estimator for $\beta_1$.

-   **SLR.1 (Linearity in Parameters)**: The parameters of the model are linear.
-   **SLR.2 (Random Sampling)**: All observations in our sample are randomly sampled from the population.
-   **SLR.3 (Sample Variation in** $x$**)**: The sample values of $x$ must have a non-zero variance.
-   **SLR.4 (Zero Conditional Mean)**. The error term $u$ has an expectation of 0, given any value of $x$.

We will explore each condition in detail.
:::

This section will be focused on the conditions. The next section will prove the unbiasedness of OLS under these conditions.

<br />

### Assumption SLR.1: Linearity

Assumption SLR.1 states that a model must be **linear in parameters**.

This means that the parameters of the model $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ must not be multiplied together - they must be added together.

For example, the following is linear:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$

While the following is not linear (since parameters are multiplied):

$$
y = \beta_0\beta_1x
$$

Note: This does not mean that the actual regression line must be linear - only the parameters/coefficients must not be multiplied, the variables can be. For example, the following model is still linear in parameters:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^2
$$

<br />

### Assumption SLR.2: Random Sampling

All observations in our sample are randomly sampled from the population.

To meet this condition, two criteria must be met:

-   Observations $i$ must be independent of each other - i.e. if you get $y_1$, that does not affect your chances of getting $y_2$.
-   All observations $i$ must come from the same population.

This assumption allows us to go from:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + u
$$

To the equation with indexes $i$:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i
$$

<br />

### Assumption SLR.3: Sample Variation in $x$

Recall that our $\hat\beta_1$ solution of OLS is:

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{Cov(x, y)}{Var(x)}
$$

This tells us that for $\hat\beta_1$ to exist, $Var(x) ≠ 0$.

-   Since we cannot divide by 0, so $Var(x) = 0$ would not produce any $\hat\beta_1$ estimate.

This is the only assumption that must be met in order to calculate OLS estimates (however, the other assumptions will be needed for the unbiasedness of OLS).

<br />

### Assumption SLR.4: Zero-Conditional Mean

In the population, the error term $u$ must have an expecation of 0, given all values of $x$. Mathematically:

$$
E(u|x) = 0 \text{ for all } x
$$

This also implies that the error term $u$ an $x$ are uncorrelated with each other.

-   This is because if $u$ was correlated with $x$, it would not always be equal to 0 no matter the value of $x$.

Since the correlation is 0, the covariance between $u$ and $x$ must also be 0:

$$
Cov(x,u) = 0
$$

This alternative statement relating to correlation/covariance is called **exogeneity**.

-   If this assumption is violated (where $x$ is correlated with error $u$), then we have **endogeneity**, and $x$ is considered an **endogeneous regressor**.
-   We will discuss endogeneity in more detail in chapter 7.

This is the most frequently violated of assumptions, yet arguable the most important of assumptions to ensure OLS is unbiased.

-   We will mathematically show this in the next chapter.
-   Because it is so frequently violated, we will need to introduce further methods beyond simple linear regression for accurate estimation.

# 1.5.3: Proof of Unbiasedness of OLS under Gauss-Markov

In the last section, we covered the Gauss-Markov assuptions, and how when they are met, OLS is unbiased.

In this section, we will use those assumptions to prove the unbiasedness of OLS.

-   Or in other words, we want to show $E(\beta_1) = \beta_1$

::: callout-note
## Useful Property of Summations

Before we start, here are a few key properties of summation

$$
\begin{split}& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) = 0 \\& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \bar{y}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y}) \\& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i(x_i - \bar{x}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2\end{split}
$$
:::

We want to show $E(\beta_1) = \beta_1$. Let us start off with the OLS estimator (which we derived in [section 4.4](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/4.html#mathematics-of-the-ordinary-least-squares-estimator)):

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

::: callout-note
## SLR.3 Variance in $x$

The existence of $\hat{\beta}_1$ is guaranteed by condition 2 from above, since the denominator is equal to $Var(x)$, so that must not be 0.

Thus, this Gauss-Markov condition must be met.
:::

<br />

Let us look at the numerator. Let us expand the numerator:

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n [(x_i - \bar x)y_i - (x_i - \bar x) \bar y] \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x) \bar y \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \bar y\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x) \\
\end{split}
$$

We know that $\sum (x_i - \bar x) = 0$. Thus, we can further simplify to:

$$
\begin{split}
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \bar y\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x) \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \bar y(0) \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i
\end{split}
$$

Thus, putting the numerator back in, we now we have the equation:

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

<br />

Now, let us play with the numerator more (note the properties of summation introduced earlier):

$$
\begin{split}
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})y_i \\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i) \\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) \beta_0 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) \beta_1  x_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) u_i \\
& = \beta_0 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) + \beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) x_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) u_i \\
& = 0 + \beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})u_i\end{split}
$$

Now, putting the numerator back into the equation, we simplify:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{\beta}_1 & = \frac{\beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \\
&  =  \beta_1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \\
&  = \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i u_i
\end{split}
$$

Where $w_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$, which is a function of random variable $x$.

-   We could also write $w_i$ as $\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{SST_x}$ (where $SST_x$ is total sum of squares for $x$).

Since $w_i$ is a function of $x$, that means $\hat\beta_1$ is also a function of $x$ (depends on the value of $x$).

<br />

Now we need to find the expectation $E(\hat\beta_1)$. Thus, we have this equation:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\hat\beta_1|x) & = E \left( \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i u_i \bigg| x \right) \\
& = \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^nE(w_iu_i|x)
\end{split}
$$

But what does $\sum E(w_iu_i |x)$ equal? This is where our other two Gauss-Markov Conditions come into play.

::: callout-note
## SLR.4 Zero Conditional Mean

The Zero-Conditional Mean assumption says $E(u|x) = 0$.
:::

::: callout-note
## SLR.2 Random Sampling

Random Sampling allows us to put subscripts $i$ on all our equations. In our example, we said that random sampling allows us to go from $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + u$ to $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i$.

Similarly, it allows us to take the Zero Conditional Mean $E(u|x)$ to $E(u_i | x_i)$ and $E(u_i | x)$.
:::

Thus, with these two assumptions, we know that:

$$
E(u|x) = E(u_i | x_i) = E(u_i|x) = 0
$$

This means that:

$$
E(w_i u_i|X) = w_i E(u_i|x) = 0
$$

-   This is only true when both Zero-Conditional Mean and Random Sampling are true.

<br />

Now knowing what $E(w_iu_i|x)$ is, let us plug it back into our equation:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\hat\beta_1|x) & = \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^nE(w_iu_i|x) \\
& = \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n0 \\
& = \beta_1
\end{split}
$$

However, we have solved for $E(\hat\beta_1 |x)$, and not $E (\hat\beta_1)$.

This is where the **Law of Iterated Expectation**. The law says the following:

$$
E(x) = E[E(x|y)]
$$

Thus, we can use this to conclude the proof:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\hat\beta_1) & = E[E(\hat\beta_1|x)] \\
& = E(\beta_1) \\
& = \beta_1
\end{split}
$$

-   Since $\beta_1$ is the true value (a constant), its expectation is itself

Thus, $E(\hat\beta_1) = \beta_1$, proving the unbiasedness of OLS under the Gauss-Markov conditions.

<br />

The key assumption is Zero conditional mean (SLR.4). What causes this final assumption, zero conditional mean $E(u|x) = 0$, to be violated?

1.  Omitted Variable Bias. This is because if we have any other variable correlated with $y$ and $x$ in the error term $u_i$, $E(u|x)$ will be violated. (we will discuss this more in chapter 7)
2.  Measurement Error in our variables (this is discussed in part III of the course).
3.  Sample Selection is not random.
4.  Simultaneity, when $x$ has an effect on $y$ and $y$ has an effect on $x$.

What can we do to remedy this assumption so OLS is not biased?

1.  Add control variables with multiple linear regression (discussed in [chapters 6](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/6.html) and 7)
2.  Use instrumental variables estimation to address the entire problem (discussed in chapter 11).

# 1.5.4: Variance of the OLS Estimator and Homoscedasticity

We have proved that OLS is unbiased under 4 conditions.

However, if we recall from [section 2.8](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2.html#properties-of-estimators), unbiasedness is not the only thing we care about in an estimator. We also care about the estimator's variance.

For example, in the figure below, we have two unbiased estimators centred on the same real parameter value. However, the second estimator $w_2$ is far more varied than the first estimator $w_1$. That means while both are unbiased, the estimator $w_2$ often produces specific sample estimates that are farther from the true parameter value.

![](images/clipboard-4236264762.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Luckily, the Gauss-Markov Theorem does not stop at unbiasedness. With an additional condition (homoscedasticity), we can determine that OLS is not only unbiased, but the linear estimator with the least variance:

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Gauss-Markov Theorem

The Gauss-Markov Theorem states that under 4 conditions, the OLS estimator is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) for $\beta_1$, being the unbiased linear estimator with the least variance.

-   **SLR.1 (Linearity in Parameters)**: The parameters of the model are linear.
-   **SLR.2 (Random Sampling)**: All observations in our sample are randomly sampled from the population.
-   **SLR.3 (Sample Variation in** $x$**)**: The sample values of $x$ must have a non-zero variance.
-   **SLR.4 (Zero Conditional Mean)**. The error term $u$ has an expectation of 0, given any value of $x$.
-   **SLR.5 (Homoscedasticity)**: The error term has the same variance given any value of $x$.
:::

<br />

But what does this new condition of homoscedasticity mean?

Mathematically, homoscedasticity is defined as:

$$
Var(u|x) = \sigma^2 \text{ for all } x
$$

First of all, what even is the variance $Var(u)$ representing? It is the variance of the "errors" of our error term $u_i$, which is also a random variable. The figure below displays this, with the green lines representing the distribution of $u_i$.

![](images/clipboard-3513031173.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

In the figure above, you can see the variance (spread) of the error term $u_i$'s distribution is consistent, no matter the value of $x$. This means that homoscedasticity is met.

When $Var(u)$ is not constant (and changes with the value of $x$, we have **heteroscedasticity**.

The best way to identify if this assumption is met is to look at a plot of the residuals (errors). If the variance in the residuals is constnant, we have homoscedasticity. If not, we have heteroscedasticity.

![](images/clipboard-1713529842.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

In the figure above, we can see on the left chart, the variance of the residuals is clearly smaller when $x$ is lower, and the variance of the residuals is larger when $x$ is higher. That is a clear violation of the homoscedasticity assumption.

-   NOTE: heteroscedasticity (failure to meet SLR.5 homoscedasticity) does not bias OLS estimates. It only determines if OLS has the lowest variance of unbiased linear estimators.

<br />

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Homepage](https://statsnotes.github.io)

# 1.5.5: Deriving Variance of OLS Estimates

Assuming Homoscedasticity is met, we know $Var(u|x) = \sigma^2$.

-   When homoscedasticity is not met, nothing in this section applies. See chapter 8 for more information on how to do estimates when this is violated.

What is variance? From [section 1.5](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/1.html#variance-and-standard-deviation), we know that the formula for variance is:

$$
E(x - \mu)^2
$$

We know from SLR.4 Zero-Conditional Mean assumption that $E(u|x) = 0$. Thus, we can use that to calculate the variance $Var(u|x)$ using the variance formula:

$$
\begin{split}
Var(u|x) = \sigma^2 & = E[ \ ((u|x) - E(u|x))^2 \ ] \\
& = E((u|x) - 0)^2 \\
& = E[(u|x)^2] \\
& = E(u^2 |x)
\end{split}
$$

And since by homoscedasticity, we know variance does not depend on $x$ such that $Var(u|x) = Var(u)$, we also know that:

$$
E(u^2|x) = E(u^2) = \sigma^2
$$

<br />

Remember when we were proving unbiasedness of OLS in section 5.3, we got to this stage:

$$
\hat\beta_1 = \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i u_i
$$

-   Where $w_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$, which is a function of random variable $x$.
-   We could also write $w_i$ as $\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{SST_x}$ (where $SST_x$ is total sum of squares for $x$).

We know that $\beta_1$ is a constant (the true value in the population), so that never changes. Thus, it cannot be the variance in $\hat\beta_1$. Thus, $\sum w_i u_i$ is the variance in $\hat\beta_1$.

$$
\begin{split}
Var(\hat\beta_1|x) & = Var\left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i u_i \bigg| x\right) \\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n Var(w_i u_i | x) \\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i^2 Var(u_i | x)
\end{split}
$$

And given SLR.2 Random Sampling (Gauss-Markov assumption), we know $Var(u_i | x)$ is also equal to $Var(u_i|x_i)$. Thus:

$$
Var(\hat\beta_1|x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i^2 Var(u_i | x_i)
$$

And using SLR.5 homoscedasticity, we know $Var(u|x) = \sigma^2$ and is constant, thus:

$$
\begin{split}
Var(\hat\beta_1 | x) & = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i^2 Var(u_i | x_i) \\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \sigma^2 \\
& = \sigma^2 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i^2
\end{split}
$$

Remember, $w_i$ is its own function of $x$, where $w_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$, or can be written as $\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{SST_x}$ (see section 5.3 for derivation).

We have $\sum w_i^2$ in our final equation, and we can do some quick algebra to rearrange it (note, if you are not familiar with SST, see [section 4.6](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/4.html#r-squared-and-goodness-of-fit)):

$$
\begin{split}
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i^2 & = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{(SST_x)^2} \\
& = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)^2}{(SST_x)^2} \\
& = \frac{SST_x}{(SST_x)^2} \\
& = \frac{1}{SST_x}
\end{split}
$$Thus, we can plug that in to get our final variance of $\hat\beta_1$ formula:

$$
\begin{split}
Var(\hat\beta|x) & = \sigma^2 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \\
& = \sigma^2 \frac{1}{SST_x} \\
& = \frac{\sigma^2}{SST_x}
\end{split}
$$

Thus, that is the variance of our OLS estimator $\hat\beta_1$, and also the variance of the sampling distribution of $\hat\beta_1$.

-   This is only the case if SLR.5 homoscedasticity assumption holds. It is not valid if the assumption is not met.
-   One might notice we calculated $Var(\hat\beta_1|x)$, not $Var(\hat\beta_1)$. However, this does not matter, since our final formula does not depend on the value of $x$ (from homoscedasticity, we know $\sigma^2$ is independent of $x$, and also $SST_x$ is constant no matter the specific value of $x$ as it includes all values of $x$).

There is one issue: we know that $\sigma^2 = E(u^2)$ (see earlier in the section). However, we do not actually know the value of $E(u^2)$! Remember, that is the error term $u$ - while we only know the residual term $\hat u$.

# 1.5.6: Standard Errors of the OLS Estimator

We know, as shown in the last section, that the variance of the sampling distribution is:

$$
Var(\hat\beta) = \frac{\sigma^2}{SST_x}
$$

If we want the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, we simply take the square root:

$$
sd(\hat\beta_1) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{SST_x}}
$$

There is one issue: we know that $\sigma^2 = E(u^2)$ (see previous section for proof). However, we do not actually know the value of $E(u^2)$! Remember, that is the error term $u$ - while we only know the residual term $\hat u$.

So, what we can do is well, simply replace $u$ with its estimate, $\hat u$.

-   Recall that $u_i = y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i$
-   And $\hat u_i = y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i$.

So naturally, instead of $\sigma^2 = E(u^2)$, we could estimate it with $E(\hat u^2)$. Mathematically:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat\sigma^2 = E(\hat u^2) & = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i^2 \\
& = SSR/n
\end{split}
$$

-   Where $SSR$ is the square sum of residuals (see [section 4.6](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/4.html#r-squared-and-goodness-of-fit) for more details).

However, there is an issue with this estimate of $\sigma^2$. It is biased - the expected value is actually slightly less than $\sigma^2$.

We will not prove this mathematically, but this bias is because OLS imposes two conditions on its estimation process (that we discussed in section 5.1):

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i \hat u_i = 0
\end{split}
$$

-   The actual error term $u_i$ (not the OLS residuals $\hat u_i$) do not have these restrictions.

We can adjust the estimator to be more accurate by including a degrees of freedom adjustment. So, instead of $SSR/n$, we can do $SSR/(n-2)$. Thus, our estimator for $\sigma^2$ is:

$$
\hat\sigma^2 = \frac{SSR}{n-2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \hat u_i^2}{n-2}
$$

With that estimate of $\sigma^2$, we can plug it back into our formula for the standard deviation of $\hat\beta_1$.

-   We call this standard deviation the standard error (as discussed in [section 2.3](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2.html#uncertainty-in-estimates-and-sampling-distributions))

$$
\widehat{se}(\hat\beta_1) = \frac{\hat\sigma}{\sqrt{SST_x}}
$$

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Standard Errors for Simple Linear Regression

The standard error for the coefficient $\hat\beta_1$ from an OLS estimator in a simple linear regression is:

$$
\widehat{se}(\hat\beta_1) = \frac{\hat\sigma}{\sqrt{SST_x}}
$$

Where $\hat\sigma$ is defined as:

$$
\hat\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{SSR}{n-2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \hat u_i^2}{n-2}}
$$

And where $SST_x$ is defined as:

$$
SST_x = \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)^2
$$

# 1.5.7: Statistical Inference in Simple Linear Regression

In the last section, we calculated the standard error of OLS estimates of $\hat\beta_1$.

If we remember from [Chapter 2](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2.html), the standard error is a measurement of uncertainty, and allows us to conduct statistical inference tests, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

-   Note: the statistical tests are only really useful if we are comfortable with the assertion that OLS is unbiased - or in other words, they are only really useful if the first 4 Gauss-Markov conditions are met.

<br />

### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing follows the same procedure as outlined in [section 2.5](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2.html#intuition-of-hypothesis-testing) and [section 2.6](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2.html#implementing-a-hypothesis-test). Reread these sections to understand the intuition.

In regression, our typical null hypotheses is that there is no relationship between $x$ and $y$, and our alternate hypothesis is that there is a relationship between $x$ and $y$. Thus, our hypotheses are:

$$
\begin{split}
& H_0 : \beta_1 = 0 \\
& H_1: \beta_1 ≠ 0
\end{split}
$$

Now, we calculate a t-test statistic:

$$
t = \frac{\hat\beta_1 - 0}{\widehat{se}(\hat\beta_1)}
$$

-   Where the 0 represents the null hypothesis value. If you have any other null hypothesis value, change the 0 to your hypothesis value.

Now, we will consult a t-distribution (not a normal distribution) to calculate the p-values.

-   We use a t-distribution, not a normal distribution, even if we have met the central limit theorem (see [section 2.4](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2.html#central-limit-theorem) if you do not know what the central limit theorem is).

-   The reason we do this is because our estimate of variance $\hat\sigma^2$ is not exactly the same as the true variance $\sigma^2$, and the t-distribution better accounts for this issue.

Once we have obtained our p-values from the t-distribution, we can interpret the p-values as follows:

::: callout-tip
## Interpretation of p-Values for Regression

The p-value is the probability of getting a test statistic equally or more extreme than the one we got with our sample estimate $\hat\beta_1$, given the null hypothesis is true.

-   If $p<0.05$, we believe the probability of the null hypothesis is low enough, such that we reject the null hypothesis (that there is no relationship between $x$ and $y$), and conclude our alternate hypothesis (that there is a relationship between $x$ and $y$).

-   If $p>0.05$, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, and cannot reject that there is no relationship between $x$ and $y$.

::: callout-warning
## Warning!

Note how I have been using the word **relationship**, not causal effect.

Causality is not established through estimators, it is established through a strong experimental design (which we will cover in part II of the course).
:::

<br />

### Confidence Intervals

We can also create confidence intervals of plausible true $\beta_1$ values from the population, given our estimate $\hat\beta_1$. The intuition is the same as discussed in [section 2.7](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2.html#confidence-intervals).

Just like previously discussed in [section 2.7](https://politicalscience.github.io/metrics/2.html#confidence-intervals), the 95% confidence interval has the bounds:

$$
\hat\beta_1 - 1.96 \widehat{se}(\hat\beta_1), \ \hat\beta_1 + 1.96 \widehat{se}(\hat\beta_1)
$$

::: callout-tip
## Interpretation of Confidence Intervals

The confidence interval means that under repeated sampling and estimating $\hat\beta_1$, 95% of the confidence intervals we construct will include the true $\beta_1$ value in the population.
:::

::: callout-warning
## Interpretation Warning!

It is very important to note that confidence intervals do not mean a 95% probability that the true $\beta_1$ is within any specific confidence interval we calculated.

We cannot know based on one confidence interval, whether it covers or does not cover the true $\beta_1$.

The correct interpretation is that over many samples from the same population, we would expect 95% of our confidence intervals to contain the true $\beta_1$ value.
