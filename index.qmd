## Introduction

This is a toolkit on commonly used statistical methods for social scientists. This guide was created during my masters degree, as a way to consolidate and store all the knowledge I have accumulated.

The guide is divided into parts, with each part containing lessons. Each lesson provides R-code for implementation purposes.

-   I recommend using a laptop or tablet to access this page. Use the sidebar for easy navigation.
-   In the appendix, I provide some guides on useful mathematical methods, R-programming, and simple machine learning.

Also, if you are interested in political science, I recommend checking out my [Quantitative Political Science Guide](https://politicalscience.github.io).

## About the Author

This website was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li.

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/) \| [Website](https://kevinli03.github.io/)
-   My other guide on [political science and political economics](https://politicalscience.github.io).

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at Kingâ€™s College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this website: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.
