## Introduction

This is a toolkit on commonly used statistical methods for social scientists. This guide was created during my masters degree, as a way to consolidate and store all the knowledge I have accumulated.

-   Note: this is not a "course" on statistics. It is a toolkit and reference material for those who already have an understanding of statistical methods, and want to implement these methods in social science research.

This toolkit is divided into sections, with each section covering a category of tools used in statistics. Sections include regression, causal inference, multivariate statistics, time series, spatial statistics, machine learning, and text analysis.

Also, if you are interested in political science, I recommend checking out my [Quantitative Political Science Guide](https://politicalscience.github.io).

## About the Author

This website was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li.

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/) \| [Website](https://kevinli03.github.io/)
-   My other guide on [political science and political economics](https://politicalscience.github.io).

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at Kingâ€™s College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this website: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.
