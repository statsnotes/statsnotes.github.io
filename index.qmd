## Introduction

This is a guide on applied statistics, with a focus on applications to the social sciences. This guide was created during my masters degree, as a way to consolidate all my knowledge and skills in one area.

The guide covers a variety of topics, including statistical theory, causal inference, multivariate statistics, spatial and time-series data, and statistical learning.

The guide is divided into parts, with each part containing lessons. You do not have to undertake the parts in order, except that *Part I* is a prerequisite for subsequent parts. Each lesson provides R-code for implementation purposes.

-   I recommend using a laptop or tablet to access this page. Use the sidebar for easy navigation.
-   In the appendix, I provide some guides on useful mathematical methods.

Also, if you are interested in political science, I recommend checking out my [Political Science and Political Economics Guide](https://politicalscience.github.io).

<br />

## Part I: Statistical and Econometric Theory

*This part introduces the key topics, regression models, and estimators used in statistics and econometrics, that form the basics of applied statistical methods.*

-   [1.5: Bivariate Regression - Properties and Inference](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/5.html)
-   [1.6: Multiple Regression - Estimation and Interpretation](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/6.html)
-   [1.7: Multiple Regression - Properties and Inference](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/7.html)
-   1.8: Heteroscedasticity, Asymptotics, and Extensions of Inference
-   1.9: Extensions of Linear Regression
-   1.10: Method of Moments Estimator
-   1.11: Instrumental Variables Estimator
-   1.12: Logistic Regression - Maximum Likelihood Estimator
-   1.13: Ordinal and Multinomial Logistic Regression
-   1.14: Regression for Count and Rate Outcomes

<br />

## Part II: Econometrics for Causal Inference

*This part introduces the most popular statistics and econometrics research designs for proving causal relationships in the social sciences.*

Pre-requisites: Part I (specifically 1.1 through 1.12).

-   2.1: Causal Inference and Causal Frameworks
-   2.2: Randomised Controlled Trials
-   2.3: Selection on Observables - Regression
-   2.4: Selection on Observables - Matching and Weighting
-   2.5: Differences-in-Differences Designs
-   2.6: Generalised Differences-in-Differences
-   2.7: Instrumental Variables - Non-Compliance Designs
-   2.8: Instrumental Variables - Further Designs
-   2.9: Regression Discontinuity Designs

<br />

## Part III: Multivariate Statistical Methods

*This part introduces the modern multivariate methods in statistics, relating to both dimensional reduction, as well as latent variable models.*

Pre-requisites: Part I

Pre-requisites: Part I

<br />

## Part V: Spatial Econometrics and Statistics

*This section introduces the concepts and methods behind spatial econometrics and the analysis of spatial data*.

## About the Author

This website was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li.

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlingfengli/) \| [Website](https://kevinli03.github.io/)
-   My other guide on [political science and political economics](https://politicalscience.github.io).

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at Kingâ€™s College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this website: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.
