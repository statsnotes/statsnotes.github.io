## Introduction

This is a guide on statistics for social scientists. This guide was created during my masters degree, as a way to consolidate and store all the knowledge I have accumulated.

The guide is divided into parts, with each part containing lessons. Each lesson provides R-code for implementation purposes.

-   I recommend using a laptop or tablet to access this page. Use the sidebar for easy navigation.
-   In the appendix, I provide some guides on useful mathematical methods, R-programming, and simple machine learning.

Also, if you are interested in political science, I recommend checking out my [Quantitative Political Science Guide](https://politicalscience.github.io).

<br />

## Part I: Introduction to Statistical Models

*This part starts by introducing the basics of statistical theory. Then, we discuss the generalised linear model - the family of models form the basis of much of statistics.*

Pre-requisites: Single Variable Calculus is helpful.

-   [1.1: Random Variables and Distributions](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/1.html)
-   [1.2: Basics of Statistical Inference](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/2.html)
-   [1.3: Relationships with Correlation and Covariance](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/3.html)
-   [1.4: Simple Linear Regression](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/4.html)
-   [1.5: Multiple Linear Regression](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/5.html)
-   [1.6: Categorical Variables in Regression](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/6.html)
-   [1.7: Interactions and Functional Form](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/7.html)
-   [1.8: Logistic Regression Model](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/8.html)
-   [1.9: Ordinal and Multinomial Logistic Models](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/9.html)
-   1.10: Poisson and Negative Binomial Models

<br />

## Part II: Econometric Theory

*In the last part, we introduced a series of models. Each model, however, requires estimators in order to fit the model. This section explores the main estimators used in econometrics, and their properties.*

Prerequisites: Part I, and single variable calculus and probability (Appendix A.1-A.6). Basic Linear Algebra is helpful but not required.

-   [2.1: Introduction and Properties of Estimators](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/1.html)
-   [2.2: The Ordinary Least Squares Estimator](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/2.html)
-   [2.3: Properties of the OLS Estimator](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/3.html)
-   [2.4: Variance of the OLS Estimator](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/4.html)
-   [2.5: Method of Moments and Instrumental Variables](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/5.html)
-   [2.6: The Maximum Likelihood Estimator](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/6.html)

<br />

## Part III: Applied Econometrics

*This part takes the theory introduced in Part I and II, and applies it to research designs and methods to identify and estimate causal effects.*

Pre-requisites: Part I and Part II.

-   3.1: Causal Inference and Causal Frameworks
-   3.2: Randomised Controlled Trials
-   3.3: Regression and Selection on Observables
-   3.4: Matching and Weighting Estimators
-   3.5: Selection on Observables - Extensions
-   3.6: Differences-in-Differences
-   3.7: Fixed Effects Estimator
-   3.8: Modern Differences-in-Differences Estimators
-   3.9: Instrumental Variable Designs
-   3.10: Examiner, Shift-Share, and Recentered Instruments
-   3.11: Sharp Regression Discontinuity Designs
-   3.12: Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity and Kink Designs

<br />

## Part IV: Multivariate Statistical Methods

*This part introduces the modern multivariate methods in statistics, relating to both dimensional reduction, as well as latent variable models.*

Pre-requisites: Part I and Part II

-   4.1: Introduction to Multivariate Statistics
-   4.2: Principle Components Analysis
-   4.3: Exploratory Factor Analysis
-   4.4: Confirmatory Factor Analysis
-   4.5: Latent Traits and Item Response Theory
-   4.6: Latent Class Models
-   4.7: Cluster Analysis
-   4.8: Structural Equation Modelling
-   4.9: Extensions to Structural Equation Modelling

<br />

## Part V: Time Series Methods

*This section introduces the statistical methods used for the analysis of time-series data, and how this can be used to make forecasts.*

Pre-requisites: Part I and Part II

<br />

## Part VI: Spatial Econometric Methods

*This section introduces the concepts and methods behind spatial econometrics and the analysis of spatial data*.

Pre-requisites: Part I, Part II, and Part III

-   6.1: Introduction to Spatial Data
-   6.2: Descriptive Indicators of Spatial Clusters
-   6.3: Spatial Weights, Aggregation, and Smoothing
-   6.4: Spatial Regression and Neighbourhood Effects
-   6.5: Causal Inference with Spatial Econometrics
-   6.6: Spatial Interaction and Discrete Choice
-   6.7: The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem
-   6.8: Machine Learning for Spatial Analysis

<br />

## About the Author

This website was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li.

-   My other guide on [political science and political economics](https://politicalscience.github.io).

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at Kingâ€™s College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this website: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.
