## Introduction

This website is a guide on applied statistics and quantitative methods, with a focus on applications to social science (economics, political science, sociology, psychology). This guide was created during my masters degree, as a way to consolidate all my knowledge and skills in one area.

The guide is divided into parts, with each part containing lessons. You do not have to undertake the parts in order, except that *Part I* is a prerequisite for subsequent parts.

I recommend using a laptop or tablet to access this page. Use the sidebar for easy navigation.

*Table of Contents:*

-   [Part I: Statistical and Econometric Theory](https://statsnotes.github.io/#part-i-statistical-and-econometric-theory)
-   [Part II: Econometric Methods for Causal Inference](https://statsnotes.github.io/#part-ii-econometric-methods-for-causal-inference)
-   [Part III: Multivariate Statistical Methods](https://statsnotes.github.io/#part-iii-multivariate-statistical-methods)

<br />

-   1.12: Logistic Regression - Maximum Likelihood Estimator
-   1.13: Ordinal and Multinomial Logistic Regression
-   1.14: Regression for Count and Rate Outcomes

<br />

## Part II: Econometric Methods for Causal Inference

*This part introduces the most popular statistics and econometrics research designs for proving causal relationships in the social sciences.*

Pre-requisites: Part I (specifically 1.1 through 1.12).

-   2.1: Causal Inference and Causal Frameworks
-   2.2: Randomised Controlled Trials
-   2.3: Selection on Observables - Regression
-   2.4: Selection on Observables - Matching and Weighting
-   2.5: Differences-in-Differences Designs
-   2.6: Generalised Differences-in-Differences
-   2.7: Instrumental Variables - Non-Compliance Designs
-   2.8: Instrumental Variables - Further Designs
-   2.9: Regression Discontinuity Designs

<br />

## Part III: Multivariate Statistical Methods

*This part introduces the modern multivariate methods in statistics, relating to both dimensional reduction, as well as latent variable models.*

Pre-requisites: Part I

-   3.1: Principle Components Analysis
-   3.2: Exploratory Factor Analysis
-   3.3: Confirmatory Factor Analysis
-   3.4: Latent Trait Models

-   3.7: Structural Equation Modelling
-   3.8: Extensions to Structural Equation Modelling

<br />

## Part IV: Time Series and Forecasting

*This section introduces the statistical methods used for the analysis of time-series data.*

Pre-requisites: Part I

<br />

## Part V: Applied Machine Learning

*This section introduces machine learning techniques for improved prediction making*.

Pre-requisites: Part I (Part III and IV are helpful, but not necessary).

<br />

## Part VI: Text Analysis

*This section introduces how we can statistically analyse textual data*

Pre-requisites: Part I and Part V.

<br />

## Part VII: Spatial Econometrics

*This section introduces the concepts behind spatial econometrics and spatial data*.

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Appendix A: Mathematical Methods

*This appendix discusses some key mathematical concepts needed for the courses above. Specifically, lessons A.1-A.6 are mandatory for Part I.*

Pre-requisites: Good background in High-School Algebra.

-   A.1: Set Theory and Algebra Review
-   A.2: Precalculus - Functions and Limits
-   A.3: Derivatives and Partial Derivatives

<br />

## Appendix B: Game Theory and Political Economics

*This guide focuses on testing theories with statistics. But where do the theories come from? Game Theory is a way to make mathematical models of the world to create hypotheses that we can test with statistics*.

Pre-requisites: Appendix A (A.1-A.6), and some basic microeconomics is helpful.

-   B.1: Preferences, Utility, and Basics of Game Theory

## About the Author

This website was created by Kevin Lingfeng Li.

I am a candidate for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), focusing on Applied Statistics/Econometrics. Prior to my Masters, I completed a BSc in Politics at Kingâ€™s College London, focusing on statistical methods and game theory, obtaining a First-Class Honours (US equivalent: Summa Cum Laude) classification. During my Undergraduate Degree, I also took classes in Data Science + Machine Learning and Accounting at the London School of Economics.

I created this page as a helpful guide while studying for my Masters degree. I realised that it would be useful for me, and for my fellow students, to have a collection of Political Science resources in one place.

I do my best to update this website: it is a tool not only for my classmates and other political science students, but for me myself. However, as a full-time student with an internship, I may not be able to update this site at a fast enough pace.
