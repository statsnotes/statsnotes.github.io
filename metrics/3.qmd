## Lesson Overview

In the last lesson, we discussed the OLS estimator for linear regressions. But we have to ask ourselves - is OLS a good estimator? Why should we use OLS? In this lesson, we focus on the properties of OLS, and the conditions under which OLS is a good estimator.

This lesson covers the following topics:

-   Some simple algebraic properties of our best-fit plane through OLS estimation.
-   The conditions on which OLS estimation is an unbiased estimator for multiple regression (Gauss-Markov conditions), and how violations of these conditions will lead to biased estimates.
-   How OLS is asymptotically consistent with a large sample size, and how that allows us to weaken one of the unbiasedness conditions.
-   How OLS is also the best approximation of the conditional expectation function.

# 2.3.1: Residuals and Properties of OLS Estimator

Once we have our OLS estimates $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ in simple linear regression, we can obtain both our fitted values, and the OLS residuals $\hat u_i$:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat u_i & = y_i - \hat y_i \\
& = y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1 x_i
\end{split}
$$

The figure below shows what a residual for a point looks like: the distance between the best fit line.

![](images/clipboard-3479749458.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

The same applies to the residuals of multiple regression, with the addition of more parameters:

$$
\begin{split}\hat u_i & = y_i - \hat y_i \\& = y_i - (\hat \beta_0 + \hat\beta_1x_{1i} + \dots + \hat\beta_k x_{ki}) \\& = y_i - \hat \beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_{1i} - \dots - \hat\beta_k x_{ki}\end{split}
$$

<br />

Recall that the OLS estimates $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ are chosen to satisfy the following first order conditions for simple linear regression (see [2.2.2](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/2.html#estimation-for-simple-linear-regression)):

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0
\end{split}
$$

For multiple regression OLS estimates of $\hat\beta_0 , \dots \hat\beta_k$ are chosen to satisfy the following first order conditions (see [2.2.4](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/2.html#estimation-for-multiple-linear-regression)):

$$
\begin{split}& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1x_{1i} -  \hat{\beta}_2x_{2i}...) = 0 \\& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_{1i}(y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1x_{1i} -  \hat{\beta}_2x_{2i}...) = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_{2i} (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1x_{1i} -  \hat{\beta}_2x_{2i}...) = 0
\end{split}
$$

-   and so on for $x_{3i}, ..., x_{ki}$.

Using these properties, we can plug in $\hat u_i$ from above to get the above conditions:

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_{ji} \hat u_i = 0
\end{split}
$$

-   Where $x_j$ is just $x$ in simple linear regression, and $x_j$ is any $x_1, \dots, x_k$ in multiple linear regression

We can use these conditions to obtain a few properties about the OLS best-fit line.

<br />

### Property 1: Sum of Residuals is 0

OLS residuals always add up to zero (for both simple and multiple regression), since:

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i = 0
$$

This property ensures that the average value of $y_i$ in our data is the same as the average value of our predictions $\hat y_i$.

<br />

### Property 2: No Covariance Between $x$ and Residual.

From above, we know the following to be true:

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i = 0
$$

Which also means that $\bar{\hat u} = 0$ (since an average is just the sum divided by the number of observations, and the sum is equal to 0).

We also know that:

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_{ji} \hat u_i = 0
$$

-   Where $x_j = x$ for simple linear regression, and $x_j = x_1, \dots, x_k$ for multiple linear regression.

Now, recall the formula for covariance discussed in [1.3.4](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/3.html#quantifying-relationships-with-covariance):

$$
Cov(x,y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n [(x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)] \\
$$

Thus, the covariance between $x_j$ (for notation simplicity, just $x$) and $\hat u$ is:

$$
\begin{split}
Cov(x, \hat u) & = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n [(x_i - \bar x)(\hat u_i - \bar{\hat u})] \\
& = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i \hat u_i - x_i \bar{\hat u} - \bar x \hat u_i + \bar x \bar {\hat u}) \\
& = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^nx_i \hat u_i - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i\bar{\hat u} - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \bar x \hat u_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\bar x \bar{\hat u} \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^nx_i \hat u_i - \bar{\hat u}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i - \bar x\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i + \bar{\hat u}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\bar x  \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^nx_i \hat u_i - 0\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i - \bar x\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \hat u_i + 0\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\bar x  \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{n}(0 -0-\bar x(0) + 0) \\
& = 0
\end{split}
$$

Thus, the covariance (and thus correlation) between $x_j$ and $\hat u$ must be zero.

<br />

### Property 3: Regression Line Passes Through Means

Remember our solution for $\hat\beta_0$ in OLS for simple linear regression was $\hat\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$. Rearranging this equation, we get:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat\beta_0  & = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} \\
\hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 \bar x & = \bar y \\
\bar y & = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 \bar x
\end{split}
$$

Thus, the OLS estimated best-fit line always passes though point $(\bar x, \bar y)$ (the means of our data). The same property applies to multiple linear regression, but for point $(\bar x_1, \dots, \bar x_k, \bar y)$.

# 2.3.2: Unbiasedness of OLS Under the Gauss-Markov Theorem

An unbiased estimator, if we recall from [2.1.2](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/1.html#unbiasedness-of-estimators), means that over many different estimates, the expected value of all the estimates is the true parameter value: $E(\hat{\theta}_n) = \theta$.

Unbiasedness is desirable property of estimators. The Gauss-Markov Theorem proves that OLS is unbiased when 4 conditions are met.

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Gauss-Markov Theorem for Simple Linear Regression

The Gauss-Markov Theorem states that under 4 conditions, the OLS estimator for simple linear regression is an unbiased estimator for $\beta_1$.

-   **SLR.1 (Linearity in Parameters)**: The parameters of the model are linear.
-   **SLR.2 (Random Sampling)**: All observations in our sample are randomly sampled from the population.
-   **SLR.3 (Sample Variation in** $x$**)**: $Var(x) ≠ 0$.
-   **SLR.4 (Zero Conditional Mean)**. $E(u|x) = 0$.
:::

For multiple linear regression, the conditions are similar but slightly different (specifically, assumption 3 and 4 are slightly different).

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Gauss-Markov Theorem

The Gauss-Markov Theorem states that under 4 conditions, the OLS estimator for multiple linear regression is an unbiased estimator for $\beta_j$.

-   **MLR.1 (Linearity in Parameters)**: The parameters of the model are linear.
-   **MLR.2 (Random Sampling)**: All observations in our sample are randomly sampled from the population.
-   **MLR.3 (No Perfect Mutlicollinearity)**: There are no exact linear relationships among variables (where correlation coefficient equals 1 or -1).
-   **MLR.4 (Zero Conditional Mean)**. $E(u|x_1, \dots, x_k) = 0$.
:::

This section will be focused on the conditions. The next sections will prove the unbiasedness of OLS under these conditions.

<br />

### Assumption SLR.1 and MLR.1: Linearity

Assumption SLR.1 and MLR.1 state that a model must be **linear in parameters**.

This means that the parameters of the model $\beta_0, \dots, \beta_k$ must not be multiplied together - they must be added together.

Note: This does not mean that the actual regression line must be linear - only the parameters/coefficients must not be multiplied, the variables can be. For example, the following model is still linear in parameters:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2^2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + u
$$

<br />

<br />

### Assumption SLR.2 and MLR.2: Random Sampling

This assumption says that all observations in our sample are randomly sampled from the same population.

The error term $u$ is some random variable (with its own probability distribution), that can be defined by its expectation $E(u)$.

-   If we randomly select one observation $i$ from the data, each observation $i$ has an equal chance of being selected.
-   The error term for that observation, $u_i$ should also have the same expectation as the random variable $u$, since each observation $i$ within $u$ has the same chance of being selected.

Thus, random sampling allows us to say $E(u) = E(u_i)$.

<br />

### Assumption SLR.3: Sample Variation in $x$

This assumption says that for our explanatory variable, $Var(x) ≠ 0$.

Basically, not all $x$ values can be the same exact number, there must be at least some variation.

<br />

### Assumption MLR.3: No Perfect Multicollinearity

This assumption says that $\sum \widetilde{r_{ij}}^2 = 0$.

-   If $\sum\widetilde{r_{ij}}^2 = 0$, that means there is no part of $x_j$ that is completely uncorrelated with any other explanatory variable. In other words, that means $x_j$ is **perfectly correlated** to at least one other explanatory variable, or a linear function of multiple other explanatory variables.

But practically, what does that mean when choosing our explanatory variables?

-   It means that we cannot choose measurements of the same concept in different units.
-   For example, you cannot include the two variables *height in inches* and *height in cm* in the same regression. This is because both variables are perfectly correlated, just differing only by a common factor.

<br />

### Assumption SLR.4 and MLR.4: Zero-Conditional Mean

In the population, the error term $u$ must have an expectation of 0, given all values of $x$. Mathematically:

$$
E(u|x_1, \dots x_k) = 0 \text{ for all } (x_1, \dots , x_k)
$$

-   For simple linear regression, it is just $E(u|x)$ (without the extra $x$ variables).

And using condition MLR.2 Random Sampling (from above), we also know that:

$$
E(u|x_1, \dots ,x_k) = E(u_i|x_{1i}, \dots, x_{ki}) = 0
$$

-   In simple linear regression, $E(u_i|x_i) = 0$.

This is the [key assumption]{.underline} of OLS, since it is the one that is most frequently violated. We will discuss this in more detail in section [2.3.6](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/3.html#exogeneity-and-endogeneity).

# 2.3.3: Proof of OLS Unbiasedness in Simple Linear Regression

In the last section, we covered the assumptions for OLS being unbiased. In this section, we will use those assumptions to prove the unbiasedness of OLS in simple linear regression. Or in other words, we want to show $E(\hat\beta_1) = \beta_1$

## Useful Properties of Summation

Before we start, here are a few key properties of summation

**Property 1:**

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) = 0
$$

-   This is because we can expand the left to $\sum x_i - \sum \bar x$.
-   Then, we know $\sum x_i = \sum \bar x$ (by the formula for mean), so $\sum x_i - \sum \bar x = 0$.

**Property 2:**

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \bar{y}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y}) 
$$

-   This is because on the right side can expand to $\sum [x_i(y_i - \bar y) - \bar x (y_i - \bar y)]$.
-   Then, split into $\sum x_i (y_i - \bar y) - \bar x \sum (y_i - \bar y)$.
-   We know that by property 1 (which applies to any variable), $\sum (y_i - \bar y) = 0$. Thus, the right side disappears, and we are left with $\sum x_i (y_i - \bar y)$.

**Property 3:**

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i(x_i - \bar{x}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

-   Start by expanding right side to $\sum [ x_i ( x_i - \bar x) - \bar x (x_i - \bar x)]$
-   Which splits into $\sum x_i (x_i - \bar x) - \bar x \sum (x_i - \bar x)$
-   By the first property, we know $\sum x_i - \bar x = 0$, so we are only left with $\sum x_i (x_i - \bar x)$
:::

<br />

We want to show $E(\hat\beta_1) = \beta_1$. Let us start off with the OLS estimator (which we derived in [2.2.2](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/2.html#estimation-for-simple-linear-regression)):

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

::: callout-note
## SLR.3 Variance in $x$

The existence of $\hat{\beta}_1$ is guaranteed by SLR.3 $Var(x) ≠ 0$, since we cannot divide by 0.
:::

<br />

Let us look at the numerator. Let us expand the numerator:

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n [(x_i - \bar x)y_i - (x_i - \bar x) \bar y] \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x) \bar y \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \bar y\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x) \\
\end{split}
$$

We know that $\sum (x_i - \bar x) = 0$ (from the properties above). Thus, we can further simplify to:

$$
\begin{split}
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \bar y\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x) \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i - \bar y(0) \\
= & \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar x)y_i
\end{split}
$$

Now, let us play with the numerator more (note the properties of summation introduced earlier):

$$
\begin{split}
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})y_i \\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i) \\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) \beta_0 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) \beta_1  x_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) u_i \\
& = \beta_0 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) + \beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) x_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) u_i \\
& = 0 + \beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})u_i\end{split}
$$

Now, putting the numerator back into the equation, we simplify:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{\beta}_1 & = \frac{\beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \\
&  =  \beta_1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \\
&  = \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i u_i
\end{split}
$$

-   Where $w_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$, which is a function of random variable $x$. We could also write $w_i$ as $\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{SST_x}$ (where $SST_x$ is total sum of squares for $x$).

Since $w_i$ is a function of $x$, that means $\hat\beta_1$ is also a function of $x$ (depends on the value of $x$).

<br />

Now we need to find the expectation $E(\hat\beta_1)$. Thus, we have this equation:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\hat\beta_1|x) & = E \left( \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i u_i \bigg| x \right) \\
& = \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^nE(w_iu_i|x)
\end{split}
$$

But what does $\sum E(w_iu_i |x)$ equal? This is where our other two Gauss-Markov Conditions come into play.

::: callout-note
## SLR.4 Zero Conditional Mean

The Zero-Conditional Mean assumption says $E(u|x) = 0$.
:::

::: callout-note
## SLR.2 Random Sampling

Random sampling, combined with zero-conditional mean, allows us to say:

$$
E(u|x) = E(u_i | x_i) = E(u_i|x) = 0
$$
:::

This means that:

$$
E(w_i u_i|x) = w_i E(u_i|x) = 0
$$

<br />

Now knowing what $E(w_iu_i|x)$ is, let us plug it back into our equation:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\hat\beta_1|x) & = \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^nE(w_iu_i|x) \\
& = \beta_1 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n0 \\
& = \beta_1
\end{split}
$$

However, we have solved for $E(\hat\beta_1 |x)$, and not $E (\hat\beta_1)$. This is where the **Law of Iterated Expectation**. The law says the following:

$$
E(x) = E[E(x|y)]
$$

Thus, we can use this to conclude the proof:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\hat\beta_1) & = E[E(\hat\beta_1|x)] \\
& = E(\beta_1) \\
& = \beta_1
\end{split}
$$

-   Since $\beta_1$ is the true value (a constant), its expectation is itself

Thus, $E(\hat\beta_1) = \beta_1$, proving the unbiasedness of OLS under the Gauss-Markov conditions.

-   The most critical assumption, and the one most frequently violated, is SLR.4 Zero-Conditional Mean. We will discuss this assumption more as the lesson progresses.

# 2.3.4: Proof of OLS Unbiasedness in Multiple Linear Regression

In the last section, we covered the proof of OLS unbiasedness for simple linear regression. Here, we cover the proof for multiple linear regression, which is similar, but has some differences.

For simplicity, let us focus on $\hat\beta_1$. However, this can be generalised to any $\hat\beta_2, \dots, \hat\beta_k$.

::: callout-note
## Useful Properties of Summations

Before we start, here are a few key properties of summation

**Property 1:**

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} = 0
$$

-   This is because $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$ is a residual term of a OLS regression of outcome $x_1$ and explanatory variables $x_2, \dots, x_k$, and we know OLS residuals sum to 0 (algebraic properties discussed in [1.6.1](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/6.html#residuals-and-properties-of-ols-estimator)).

**Property 2:**

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} x_{ji} = 0, \text{ given } j=2, \dots, k 
$$

-   Because for OLS, $\sum x_i \hat u_i = 0$ ([1.7.1](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/7.html#residuals-and-algebraic-properties-of-ols)), and we know $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$ is the residual $\hat u_i$ in a regression with explanatory variables $x_2, \dots, x_k$ and outcome variable $x_1$.

**Property 3:**

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} x_{1i} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}(\hat x_{1i} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2
$$

-   Because we have the regression fitted values $\hat x_{1i} = \hat \gamma_0 + \hat\gamma_1 x_2 + \dots + \hat\gamma_{k-1} x_{k} + \widetilde{r_{1i}}$ from [1.5.6](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/5.html#regression-anatomy-formula-for-ols-estimation).
-   And we know with regression, actual values are the predicted plus residual: $y_i = \hat y_i + \hat u_i$. Thus, $x_i = \hat x_i + \widetilde{r_{1i}}$.
:::

<br />

Recall the regression anatomy solution of OLS for $\hat\beta_1$ (derived in [2.2.6](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/2.html#regression-anatomy-formula-for-ols-estimation)):

$$
\hat\beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} \ y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2}
$$

-   Where $\widetilde{r_{1i}}$ is the part of $x_1$ uncorrelated with $x_2, \dots, x_k$.

::: callout-note
## MLR.3 No Perfect Multicollinearity

The existence of $\hat\beta_1$ is guaranteed by MLR.3 $\sum\widetilde{r_{1i}}^2 ≠ 0$, since we cannot divide by 0.
:::

Now, let us plug in $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \dots + \beta_k x_{ki} + u_i$ into our regression anatomy formula:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat\beta_1 & = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} \ y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2} \\
& = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} \ (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \dots + \beta_k x_{ki} + u_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2} \\
\end{split}
$$

Now, focusing on the numerator, and using the summation properties above, let us simplify:

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} \ (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \dots + \beta_k x_{ki} + u_i) \\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (\widetilde{r_{1i}}\beta_0 + \widetilde{r_{1i}}\beta_1x_{1i} + \dots + \widetilde{r_{1i}}\beta_k x_{ki} + \widetilde{r_{1i}} u_i) \\
& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}\beta_0 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}\beta_1 x_{1i} + \dots + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}\beta_k x_{ki} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} u_i \\
& = \beta_0 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} + \beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} x_{1i} + \dots + \beta_k \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} x_{ki} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} u_i \\
& = \beta_0 (0) + \beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2 + \beta_2 (0) + \dots + \beta_k (0) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} u_i \\
& = \beta_1 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} u_i
\end{split}
$$

Now, putting the numerator back in, we can simplify:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat\beta_1 & = \frac{\beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2} \\
& \\
& = \frac{\beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2} + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2} \\
& \\
& = \beta_1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2}
\end{split}
$$

<br />

Now, we want to find $E(\hat\beta_1)$. Note that the second part of the equation is a function of $u_i$, of which itself is a function of all explanatory variables $x_{1i}, \dots, x_{ki}$. Thus, we know:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\hat\beta_1 | x_{1i}, \dots x_{ki}) & = \beta_1 + E\left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2} \biggr|x_{1i},\dots, x_{ki} \right) \\
& = \beta_1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} \ E(u_i|x_{1i}, \dots,x_{ki})}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2}
\end{split}
$$

But what is $E(u_i|x_{1i}, \dots , x_{ki})$? We can use two Gauss-Markov conditions to evaluate this:

::: callout-note
## MLR.4 Zero Conditional Mean

The Zero-Conditional Mean assumption says $E(u|x_1, \dots, x_k) = 0$.
:::

::: callout-note
## MLR.2 Random Sampling

Random sampling, combined with Zero-Conditional Mean, allows us to say:

$$
E(u|x_1, \dots, x_k)=E(u_1|x_{1i}, \dots, x_{ki}) = 0
$$
:::

Thus, plugging that in to our formula, we get:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\hat\beta_1 | x_{1i}, \dots x_{ki}) 
& = \beta_1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} \ E(u_i|x_{1i}, \dots,x_{ki})}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2} \\
& = \beta_1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}} \ (0)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \widetilde{r_{1i}}^2} \\
& = \beta_1 + 0 \\
& = \beta_1
\end{split}
$$

Now, just like in simple linear regression, we use the **law of iterated expectations** to conclude this proof:

$$
\begin{split}
E(\hat\beta_1) & = E[E(\hat\beta_1|x_{1i}, \dots, x_{ki})] \\
& = E(\beta_1) \\
& = \beta_1
\end{split}
$$

Thus, OLS is unbiased under the Gauss-Markov conditions.

-   The most critical assumption, and the one most frequently violated, is SLR.4 Zero-Conditional Mean. We will discuss this assumption more as the lesson progresses.

# 2.3.5: Asymptotic Consistency of OLS

We have proven OLS is unbiased under the 4 Gauss-Markov conditions. The key assumption (as mentioned multiple times) is Zero-Conditional Mean:

$$
E(u|x_1, \dots x_k) = 0
$$

This assumption means that the error term $u$ cannot be correlated with any $x_1, \dots x_k$, OR any function of $x_1, \dots, x_k$. This is quite restrictive.

However, this assumption can be weakened to a new assumption:

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Zero Mean and Exogeneity Assumption

We can weaken *MLR.4 Zero-Conditional Mean* to the *Zero-Mean and Exogeneity assumption*:

$$
\begin{split}
& E(u) = 0 \\
& Cov(x_j, u) = 0, \quad \text{for } j = 1,\dots k
\end{split}
$$

The second assumption can also be rewritten as:

$$
E(x_j u) = 0
$$

-   The proof of this is almost identical to the proof of $\sum x \hat u = 0$ implying $Cov(x, \hat u) = 0$ we did in section 2.3.1.

Note: if we meet the full MLR.4 Zero-Conditional Mean assumption, we will automatically meet this weakened assumption. However, the reverse is not true.

[Under this new assumption (and the other 3 Gauss-Markov assumptions), OLS is biased in small sample sizes, but asymptotically consistent.]{.underline}
:::

This assumption is weaker than our original assumption MLR.4 Zero-Conditional Mean, as we no longer need to have $u$ uncorrelated with any function of $x_1, \dots, x_k$. We only need $u$ to be uncorrelated with each $x_j$ individually.

Under this new assumption (and the other 3 Gauss-Markov assumptions), OLS is biased in small sample sizes, but asymptotically consistent. In other words:

$$
\text{plim}(\hat\beta_j) = \beta_j
$$

<br />

### Proof of OLS Asymptotic Consistency

::: callout-warning
## Warning!

Ensure you understand section [2.1.5](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/1.html#asymptotic-consistency-of-estimators) well before starting this section.
:::

In section 2.3.3, we got to this point when proving unbiasdeness:

$$
\hat\beta_1=  \beta_1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

We can add $\frac{1}{n}$ (or $n^{-1}$) to the top and bottom of the fraction (which cancel each other out, keeping the equation equivalent):

$$
\hat\beta_1=  \beta_1 + \frac{n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x}) u_i}{n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

Now, let us expand the numerator, and simplify, and we get:

$$
\begin{split}
\hat\beta_1 & =  \beta_1 + \frac{n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i u_i - n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \bar x u_i}{n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \\
& =  \beta_1 + \frac{n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i u_i - \bar x \ n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n u_i}{n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \\
& =  \beta_1 + \frac{ \overline{xu} - \bar x \bar u}{S.Var(x)}
\end{split}
$$

-   Where $S.Var(x)$ is the sample variance of $x$.

We want to find $\text{plim}(\hat\beta_1)$. We will need a few properties for this:

::: callout-note
## Properties of Probability Limits

We know these general rules about probability limits (see [2.1.5](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/1.html#asymptotic-consistency-of-estimators))

$$
\begin{split}
& \text{plim}(\bar x_n) = \mu _x \\
& \text{plim}(S.Var(x_i)) = Var(x_i) \\
& \text{plim}(S.Cov(x_i, y_i)) = Cov (x_i, y_i)
\end{split}
$$

The other properties are about algebra with probability limits. Assume $\text{plim} (u_n) = a$, and $\text{plim}(v_n) = b$. Then, the following are true:

$$
\begin{split}
& \text{plim} (u_n + v_n) = a + b \\
& \text{plim} (u_n v_n) = ab \\
& \text{plim} (u_n v_n) = a/b
\end{split}
$$
:::

Knowing this, we then know that:

$$
\begin{split}
\text{plim}(\hat\beta_1) & = \beta_1 + \frac{ \text{plim}(\overline{xu}) - \text{plim}( \bar x \bar u) }{ \text{plim}(S.Var(x))} \\
& = \beta_1 + \frac{ \text{plim}(\overline{xu}) - \text{plim}(\bar x) \text{plim}(\bar u) }{ \text{plim}(S.Var(x))} \\
&  = \beta_1 + \frac{ E(xu) - E(x) E(u) }{Var(x)} \\
\end{split}
$$

::: callout-note
## Zero-Mean and Exogeneity Assumption

The weakened Zero-Mean and Exogeneity assumption states:

$$
\begin{split}
& E(u) = 0 \\
& E(xu) = 0
\end{split}
$$
:::

Using this assumption, we can conclude the proof:

$$
\begin{split}
\text{plim}(\hat\beta_1) & = \beta_1 + \frac{ E(xu) - E(x) E(u) }{Var(x)} \\
& = \beta_1 + \frac{ 0 - E(x)0}{Var(x)} \\
& = \beta_1 + \frac{ 0 }{Var(x)} \\
& = \beta_1+0 \\
\text{plim}(\hat\beta_1) & = \beta_1
\end{split}
$$

Thus, OLS is asymptotically consistent under a weakened version of MLR.4 Zero-Conditional Mean - called the Zero-Mean and Exogeneity Assumption.

-   Under this weakened assumption (without meeting the full MLR.4 assumption), OLS is [biased but consistent]{.underline}.

# 2.3.6: Exogeneity and Endogeneity

We have proven that OLS is unbiased under the key assumption of MLR.4 Zero-Conditional Mean:

$$
E(u|x_1, \dots x_k) = 0
$$

We also proven that OLS is asymptotically consistent under a weaker version of the assumption: Zero-Mean and Exogeneity:

$$
\begin{split}
& E(u) = 0 \\
& Cov(x_j, u) = 0, \quad \text{for } j = 1,\dots k
\end{split}
$$

The critical part of both assumptions is **Exogeneity**.

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Exogeneity and Endogeneity

**Exogeneity** is defined as each explanatory variable being uncorrelated with the error term:

$$
Cov(x_j, u)=0 \quad \text{for } j =1, \dots, k
$$

If this is violated, it is called **endogeneity**. An endogenous regressor is defined as an explanatory variable that is correlated with the error term.

If exogeneity is violated and endogeneity is present, two things happen:

1.  We fail the "weak" Zero-Mean and Exogeneity condition, meaning OLS is not asymptotically consistent if we have endogeneity.
2.  We fail MLR.4 Zero-Conditional Mean, meaning OLS is biased.

Thus, Exogeneity is a neccesary condition for OLS estimator to be reliable for estimation.
:::

<br />

We want to avoid Endogeneity, as it means OLS is both biased and asymptotically inconsistent.

-   That basically means when endogeneity is present, under no circumstances can we rely on the accuracy of the estimates of OLS.

But what causes Endogeneity? The main cause of endogeneity is Omitted Variable Bias (covered in [1.5.3](https://statsnotes.github.io/intro/5.html#omitted-variable-bias-and-confounding-variables)).

-   The omitted confounding variable $z$'s effect is mostly subsumed into the error term $u_i^S$ of the short regression.
-   But some bit of $z$ (that is correlated with $x$) is included in our coefficient (specifically, $\beta_2 \delta_1$).
-   That means our explanatory variable $x$ will be correlated with the error term, meaning we have endogeneity and unreliable OLS estimates.

However, there are other factors that can cause endogeneity as well.

-   Simultaneity can cause endogeneity: when both the explanatory variable and outcome variable explain each other.
-   Measurement error can also cause endogeneity.

<br />

How can we solve this problem?

-   The easiest way is to add more control variables.
-   If we include every single possible confounder that is correlated both with our explanatory variable of interest, and the outcome variable, then, there will be no more omitted variable bias, and no more endogeneity.

However, as we will discuss a lot more in Part III on applied econometrics and causal inference, including all confounding variables is often impossible, as many social science situations will have thousands of them, many of them **unobservable** or impossible to measure.

-   Thus, there are also other techniques to "unbias" OLS without including all possible confounders. We will discuss an example of this in [lesson 2.6](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/6.html) on instrumental variables.

# 2.3.7: OLS and the Conditional Expectation Function

We previously discussed random variables and distributions in [lesson 1.1](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/1.html). There, we learned that random variables can be characterised by distributions, which can be summarised with the expectation and variance.

$y$ in a regression is also a random variable.

-   For example, imagine income was $y$.
-   There is a distribution of income in a population - such that if we randomly selected someone from the population, there would be a probability associated with selecting someone with an income between \$60,000-\$70,000.

We can characterise the distribution of $y$ with its expected value: $E(y)$.

A **conditional expectation function** says that the value of $E(y)$ depends on the value of $x$. We notate a conditional expectation function as $E(y|x)$.

-   For example, imagine $y$ is income and $x$ is age.
-   A conditional expectation function $E(y|x)$ says that as $x$ (age) changes, the expected value of $y$ (income) also changes.
-   For example, you would probably expect the expected value of a 20 year old's income to be different than a 50 year old's.

<br />

The Ordinary Least Squares Regression line also is the best linear approximation of the conditional expectation function $E(y|x)$. That means, we can view a regression as also a conditional expectation function.

::: callout-tip
## Definition: Linear Conditional Expectation Function

The conditional expectation function is some function which describes the conditional expectation of $y$ given $x$. This function can be linear, or not:

$$
E(y_i|x_i) = m(x_i)
$$

-   Where $m(x_i)$ is some function (does not have to be linear).

A best linear approximation of a conditional expectation function, can take the following form:

$$
E(y_i|x_i) = b_0 + b_1x_i
$$

-   Where $b_0$ and $b_1$ are the parameters/coefficients of the model.
-   Where $E(y_i|x_i)$ is the expectation of the conditional distribution $y|x$.
-   Where the conditional distribution $y|x$ has variance $\sigma^2$ (this assumption we will explore in more detail in the [next lesson](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/7.html)).

The best linear approximation of the conditional expectation function is defined as the parameters that minimise the mean squared errors (MSE).

$$
\begin{split}
MSE & = E(y_i - E(y_i|x_i))^2 \\
& = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n( y_i - E(y_i|x_i))^2
\end{split}
$$
:::

<br />

What we want to prove is that the OLS estimates $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ best estimate the parameters $b_0$ and $b_1$ of the Conditional Expectation Function, which means that if true, OLS is the best linear approximation of the conditional expectation function.

Suppose we have the conditional expectation function:

$$
E(y_i|x_i) = b_0 + b_1x_i
$$

We also know that our typical regression equation is:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i
$$

We know that $E(u_i|x_i) = 0$. Let us define $u_i$ as the following:

$$
u_i = y_i - E(y_i|x_i)
$$

If the above defined $u_i$ is true, $E(u_i|x_i)$ should also be equal to 0. So, let us plug in the above $u_i$ into $E(u_i | x_i)$.

$$
\begin{split}
E(u_i|x_i) & = E(y_i - E(y_i|x_i) \ | \ x_i) \\
& = E(y_i|x_i) - E(y_i|x_i) \\
& = 0
\end{split}
$$

Thus, we know $u_i = y_i - E(y_i|x_i)$ to be true. Thus, rearranging, we know:

$$
y_i = E(y_i|x_i) + u_i
$$

We also know that $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i$. Thus, the following is true:

$$
\begin{split}
E(y_i|x_i) + u_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + u_i \\
b_0 + b_1 + u_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + u_i \\
b_0 + b_1 & = \beta_0 + \beta_1
\end{split}
$$

Well, you might point out, it is still possible that $b_1 ≠ \beta_1$ in this scenario. We can go further. We know that the conditional expectation function minimises the mean of squared errors.

$$
\begin{split}
MSE & = \min\limits_{b_0, b_1} E(y_i - E(y_i|x_i))^2 \\
& = \min\limits_{b_0, b_1} E(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1x_i)^2
\end{split}
$$

The first order conditions are (using chain rule and partial derivatives, just like in the OLS derivation):

$$
\begin{split}
& E(y_i - b_0 - b_1x_i) = 0 \\
& E(x_i(y_i - b_0 - b_1x_i) = 0
\end{split}
$$

<br />

Now, recall our OLS minimisation conditions (from [2.2.3](https://statsnotes.github.io/metrics/2.html#estimation-for-simple-linear-regression))

$$
\begin{split}
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0 \\
& \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) = 0
\end{split}
$$

Since by definition, average/expectation is $E(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i$, we can rewrite the OLS minimisation conditions as:

$$
\begin{split}
& n \times E(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i) = 0 \\
& n \times E(x_i(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i)) = 0
\end{split}
$$

And since anything multiplied to a zero turns into zero, we can ignore the $n$ in the first order condition, and only focus on the expected value part. Thus, our conditions are:

$$
\begin{split}
& E(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i) = 0 \\
& E(x_i(y_i - \hat\beta_0 - \hat\beta_1x_i)) = 0
\end{split}
$$

Which as we can see, are the exact same minimisation conditions as the conditional expectation function. Thus, OLS is the best approximation of the conditional expectation function.

<br />

The fact that OLS best approximates the conditional expectation function is an immensely useful property of OLS.

-   We know that the expectation of a random variable is the best guess of the random variable's value (as explained in [1.1.4](https://statsnotes.github.io/theory/1.html#expected-value-and-mean)).
-   We also now know that OLS best approximates the conditional expectation function $E(y|x)$.
-   Thus, OLS estimates $\hat y$ are the best guess of the value of $y$, given any values of $x$. This is immensely useful in both prediction purposes and causal estimation purposes (which we will focus on in later parts of the guide).

This is also why when discussing interpretation of OLS coefficients in both simple and multiple linear regression, we have been describing the change in the [expected]{.underline} value of $y$.
